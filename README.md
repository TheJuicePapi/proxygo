# Proxygo - by TheJuicePapi

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first ever project / upload.

This is an automated python script to start tor services then proxychains right after that launches directly into a firefox browser.
When you close the browser tor services will be automatically disabled upon exit.

You will need to have previously installed tor services 'sudo apt-get install tor' 
You will also need to have installed proxychains 'sudo apt-get install proxychains'

*** Dont forget to configure both tor & proxychains beforehand ***

Simply download the script and place it in your /home/usr directory folder.
Then to launch  open the terimal and use 'python3 proxygo.py'



This script has been tested on a RPI 4b model running a kali linux arm.
